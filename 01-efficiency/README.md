# Perry Efficiency Experiment
This experiment runs Perry over several targets and collects the elapsed time.

## Running the experiment
1. Execute the following commands:
```shell
PERRY_PATH=/path/to/perry ./run.sh
```

2. The generated hardware models (`*.c` files), the generated logs (`*.log`), and the collected execution time (`result.csv`) will be placed under this directory.
